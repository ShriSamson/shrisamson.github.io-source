Summary: About me page

Hi, my name is Shri Samson. I'm studying to become a data scientist.

I completed my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering at Fresno State. During my breaks from college I worked as a wireless test engineer at Silver Spring Networks writing scripts in python to test networking devices. There I got my first taste for significant data analysis, measuring product performance, modeling ways to improve it, and presenting results to stakeholders within and outside the company.

My first engineering job out of college I worked for SolarCity designing rooftop solar systems for over 700 homes. After leaving SolarCity I realized this was the best time to commit to changing careers and doing the kind of work which excited me the most.

I want to become a data scientist for 2 reasons:

1. I enjoy finding patterns in data the most in my work.

2. I think data science will be the most exciting field over the next decade and for many more to come.

I'm currently taking [Springboard's Career Track program](www.springboard.com) where I'll get to work on progressively challenging data projects with feedback from an industry mentor. Stay tuned to my blog to see the projects I complete and follow me along on my journey!
